# Pneumonia_Classfication_tf

Project based on Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Image classification model for Pneumonia positive or negative lung x-rays using Tensorflow

Convolutional Neural Net using RMSprop optimizer and Binary CrossEntropy to classify x-rays.
Imbalanced dataset favoring pneumonia positive patients, therefore a model accuracy was not a valid metric

Created confusion matrix in order to get precision and recall

# Obtained 94% precision and 85% recall.
